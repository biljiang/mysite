					<p>Video provides a powerful way to help you prove your point.
					When you click Online Video, you can paste in the embed code for the video you
					want to add. You can also type a keyword to search online for the video that
					best fits your document. To make your document look professionally produced,
					Word provides header, footer, cover page, and text box designs that complement
					each other. For example, you can add a matching cover page, header, and
					sidebar. Click Insert and then choose the elements you want from the different
					galleries. Themes and styles also help keep your document coordinated. When you
					click Design and choose a new Theme, the pictures, charts, and SmartArt
					graphics change to match your new theme. When you apply styles, your headings
					change to match the new theme. Save time in Word with new buttons that show up
					where you need them.</p>
